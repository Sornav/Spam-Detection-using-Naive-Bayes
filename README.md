Spam Detection using Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier,here I have Used Multinomial Naive Bayes Classfier to filter spam SMS using the "spam.csv" which I got from kaggle.I have used Plotly to visualize my data,and for fitting the model I have taken a range of alpha values and chose the  alpha value with the best accuracy and precision,this model achieves over 98% accuracy on the training dataset.
